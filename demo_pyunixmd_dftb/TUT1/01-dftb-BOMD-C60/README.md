#After submitting the task, sbatch submit.sh. You will see this generating SCRADIR.
#SCRADIR is used to store computational data during calculations using pyUNIXMD. 
1.If the computation process is not finished, the run-out output file is saved in SCRADIR.
2.If the computation process is finished, the run-out output file will be under the same path as SCRADIR. Also, there will be a backup of the output file in SCRADIR.
